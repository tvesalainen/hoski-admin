Runtime installation
====================

Create a directory for installed application.

Download installation zip-file from http://hsk-members.appspot.com/HoskiAdmin.zip

Extract zip contents to created file

HoskiAdmin.bat will launch the application

Create HoskiAdmin.properties and edit it.

You can add following entries 

remoteserver = <server>
remoteuser = <your username>
remotepassword = <password>

We recommend that you leave remotepassword empty. In that case password can be entered
at launch.
